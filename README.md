# Chip Visualization: Image Similarity Search

This project explores the fascinating world of image similarity using visualization techniques like cosine similarity, Euclidean distance. It offers a Python-based solution to find the 7 most similar images within a given dataset.

### Key Features:

- Deep Learning for Accuracy: Uses powerful pre-trained models like VGG, ResNet50, and AlexNet, combined with the cosine similarity metric, for accurate image matching.

### Under the Hood:

This project harnesses the power of Python and various libraries:

- PIL(Python Imaging Library): For image Processing 
- Scipy: For numerical computations and advanced algorithms.
- Glob: For efficiently searching through directories of images.
- NumPy: For efficient array manipulation and mathematical operations.
- Matplotlib: For creating informative visualizations.
